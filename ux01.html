                    <p>Huddle is a facility booking application for IUPUI student/faculties. Integrated into the <a
                            herf="https://one.iu.edu">ONE.IU</a> platform, Huddle makes meeting/conference room booking easy.</p>
                    <p>The application displays bookable meeting/conference rooms across IUPUI campus. Availability of rooms is color coded on the map. The user could quickly apply search/check/book actions via the app.</p>

                    <p>College students always have to meet as groups to discuss team projects. As IUPUI students, the University Library(UL) is the most popular location for group meetings, however, it's not an easy task to book a room in the University Library(UL) due to various reasons. To understand those reasons and to find a design solution, 12 Contextural Inquires were conducted with IUPUI students.</p>
                    <p>The 12 contextual inquiries were conducted respectively in the Graduate Lab in the School of Informatics, the lobby of Student Center, and a group study room in the University Library. We observed all of those group meetings to see how do they decide a place for the next meeting and how would they communicate before that meeting. </p>
                    <p>Through the contectural inqury, two main reasons were identified. First, the University Library is an independent system that does not even work with IU accounts, and this requires a user to register a UL account before using its facilities. Second, students have their preferred messaging apps, and usaually they are different. Those bring in communication barriers.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Evaluation Summary</strong></h3>
                    <p>In order to validate and assess our product, we conducted usability testing with four potential
                        users. Our design solution to the problem of student communication and collaboration was three&ndash;fold.
                        First, we allow for third party applications to be easily integrated with OUE. IU and our mobile
                        app, Huddle. Second, we improve upon the existing OUE. IU to include features such as cross&ndash;platform
                        communication and room booking features for campus buildings. Third, we take the first two
                        solutions and make it mobile so that students can communicate and collaborate on the go.</p>
                    <p>Because the first two solutions were not as involved, we evaluated only the mobile application,
                        Huddle, with potential users. All users were provided a Task Error Record Sheet, in which we
                        asked them to note errors related to confusion, missteps, mistakes, task execution, and design
                        and interaction problems while interacting with the prototype. </p>
                    <h3><strong>Evaluation Findings</strong></h3>
                    <p>Majority of the problems identified by the users are low severity. Issues are mostly related to
                        terminology, messaging, calendar, and history.</p>

                    <p><strong><i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Terminology</strong></p>
                    <p>Some users were confused by some of the terminologies. For example, they did not understand the
                        difference between &ldquo;Available&rdquo; and &ldquo;Huddle&rdquo; when reserving on-campus
                        rooms for booking.</p>

                    <p><strong><i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Messaging</strong></p>
                    <p>One user did not understand the flow of the application after booking a room, because the app
                        would jump over to the Messaging feature. He expressed that when a new message is received in
                        the Messaging feature, that should be indicated in a red bubble instead of the existing blue
                        color. Additionally, he felt that the app should take the user to the homepage instead of
                        directing the users to the messaging feature immediately after booking a room. Additionally,
                        some users felt that it 'd be good to include the names of individuals in each of the messaging
                        group instead of an overall group label.</p>

                    <p><strong><i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Calendar</strong></p>
                    <p>Some users felt that the Calendar function of the app was too cluttered. For example, they
                        expressed that there were too many &ldquo;dot&rdquo;s on the calendar, which were used as a
                        legend to indicate which calendars the user can view at the same time, that ranged from Umail,
                        Canvas, Huddle, and Gmail.

                    <p><strong><i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>History</strong></p>
                    <p>One user felt that the icon used to represent the History log needed to be changed. He expressed
                        that the existing icon reminds him of a clock and thus, the icon should be improved upon to
                        indicate History more clearly.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3><strong>SUS Ratings</strong></h3>
                    <p>In addition to the Task Error Record Sheet, we had users complete a Post&ndash;Evaluation
                        Questionnaire that we created. The survey comprised of 10 questions related to the System
                        Usability Scale (SUS). Evaluators were asked to rate the system on a 5 point scale where 1 stood
                        for &ldquo;strongly disagree&rdquo; and 5 stood for &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo;.</p>

                    <p>Overall, the feedback that we received in the Post-Evaluation Questionnaire in terms of the
                        utility of the product was very positive, but we attribute some of the lower ratings to the
                        errors that evaluators mentioned during the Task Error assessment.</p>
