                    <p><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> is a music streaming service that provides users
                        with access to millions of songs. Up to Aug 2016, Spotify has garnered 39 million active
                        subscribers worldwide.</p>
                    <p>Our HCI graduate team* performed a usability testting to evaluate Spotify’s desktop and iOS mobile app. The testing method hybrids cognitive walkthough and heuristic evaluation. Based on the evaluation results, we propose design recommendations for spotify desktop and iOS versions.</p>

                <h3><strong>Spotify</strong></h3>
                <p>Spotify is a music streaming service that allows you to listen to millions of songs from a large variety of artists and albums. Some of its features include: creating and sharing a playlist, following your friends, enabling collaboration on playlists to share them with friends. </p> 
                <p> Although Spotify is a great product, there is room for improvement. Our team identified some existing issues and has suggested recommendations for Spotify that could make it more intuitive and give music lovers a rewarding experience, both in desktop and mobile application. </p>

                <h3><strong>Evaluation Summary</strong></h3>
                <p>Before the usability test, we performed a qucik expert review to identify potential issues of spotify, and based on the findings we generated seven tasks, such as Search Songs, Create a Playlist, Add/Delete songs from a playlist, Follow Friends, Share Playlist, and Create Collaborative Playlist. </p>

                <img src="images/portfolio-details/ux02-3.png" style="width:100%" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                <p class="text-center">Usability Testing Tasks</p>
                <br/>
                <p>10 participants were recruited to complete those tasks on both the web and mobile application. All users completed a post-task comfort rating as well as pre-test and post-test questionnaire to collect demographical data and assess the overall usability of Spotify (SUS score). After performing a competitive analysis between the Spotify Desktop and Mobile application we generalized results between both platforms. </p>
                <p>To ensure the efficiency of our usability test, we conducted a pilot study before the full-scale test. </p>

                <p>Overall, it was noted that the users could perform most of the tasks in the desktop application more easily as compared to the mobile application. Though users found the mobile application difficult to use in comparison with the desktop application, they found that the feedback from the mobile application very useful. Our final conclusions point to the Spotify mobile application being more cumbersome to use as compared to the desktop application.</p>

        <h2 class="page-header">Methodology</h2>
        <div id="carousel-example-generic" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel"></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
                <p><strong>What We Tested?</strong></p>
                <p>Our team did a competitive comparison of the Spotify desktop application versus the mobile
                    application. For mobile, we primarily focused on the iOS platform. We also performed the entire test
                    using the free version. </p>

                <p><strong>Who We Tested?</strong></p>
                <p>A total of 10 users participated in the study. All users tested the desktop application as well as
                    the mobile application. Users were from a variety of backgrounds that included undergraduate
                    students, graduate students, and working professionals. </p>

                <p><strong>Where We Tested?</strong></p>
                <p>The majority of sessions took place in the study/conference rooms available in the library and the
                    UITS lab. Other testing sessions took place at the participant's house or place of employment.</p>

                <p><strong>When We Tested?</strong></p>
                <p>User testing took place from November 9 through November 21, 2015.</p>

                <p><strong>How We Tested?</strong></p>
                <p>The format used was one-on-one usability test sessions. All sessions took around 60 minutes or less
                    to complete.</p>

                <h3><strong>Experimental Setup</strong></h3>
                <p>For all user testing, an interviewer and observer were present. The observer gathered notes on the
                    user’s reactions, facial and verbal expressions, etc. All users were asked to implement the
                    <strongh>Think-Aloud strategy</strongh> throughout the session to provide further information. The interviewer
                    clarified the tasks that were given to the user, guide them through tasks if necessary, and prompt
                    users to think-aloud when they were stumped. Live video recording of all user-testing sessions was
                    also taken to provide the team with a holistic view of user actions.</p>
                <p>The following equipment was used for all desktop user-testing sessions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>iOS based laptop/computer with the Spotify
                        Desktop Application installed on it.

                    <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>AZ Screen Recorder, QuickTime Player and
                        Captivate 9 for audio and video recording.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The list below consists of equipment used for mobile testing sessions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Android / Apple phone with Spotify mobile
                        application installed on it.

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Users were asked to complete various tasks such as searching for songs, creating a playlist, adding
                    songs to that playlist, finding friends and following them, sharing playlist with friends etc. A
                    complete list of all tasks used for the mobile and desktop version of Spotify can be found in the
                    appendix. In addition, users were asked to fill out a consent form and also complete a post-task and
                    a post-test questionnaire. These forms can be found in the appendix of the <a href="assets/Spotify_FinalReport_Fall2015.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Global results:</strong> Participants are more aware of what is happening (visibility of
                    system status) better on mobile compared to desktop. There’s almost immediate feedback when the user
                    performs an action on mobile but it’s almost non-existent on desktop. However, desktop has more
                    prominent buttons and labels that allows the user to notice them quicker. Certain icons were not
                    easily recognized by the user or were quickly dismissed. Users with a Facebook account are able to
                    connect and perform certain tasks faster, such as finding friends, following, and sharing playlist.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> For the mobile version we suggest a tab menu rather than a hamburger
                    menu so that the user can rely on recognition rather than recall. In addition, visibility could be
                    enhanced by increasing the color contrast between type color and background (e.g. participants did
                    not notice when a playlist was collaborative even though the lable appeared above it).</p>
